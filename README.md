## Installation

## What does zsh do?

- https://github.com/hmml/awesome-zsh

Since `zsh` is not `bash`, it doesn't use your `~/.bashrc` file anymore.

Instead, it loads the file `~/.zshrc`. All of your zsh configuration should go in here.

Other, non-zsh-related configuration can be placed in a `~/.profile` file, things like:
- Exporting environment variables
- Configuring aliases
- Etc...

Then, in your `~/.zshrc` file, you can include the `~/.profile` by placing the following at the bottom of your `~/.zshrc`:
```
if [ -f ~/.profile ]; then
  source ~/.profile
fi
```
